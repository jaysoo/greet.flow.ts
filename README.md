A small example of writing TypeScript code that can be type checked with Flow.

Try it yourself!

```
npm install
npm test
```

The greet.ts file uses the Flow comment syntax, which is preserved by the TypeScript compiler.
For users of this module, both TypeScript definitions and Flow definitions are available.
